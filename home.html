        <h2>Hiking Essentials</h2>
        <p>Before setting off on your first big hike, it is vital to bring the right gear with you for your journey.
            A big walk might not seem like a challenge, but long stretches of excercise coupled with Ireland's almost random weather patterns could turn your walk into a miserable trek in minutes. 
            Use our checklist below to ensure you are ready for any elements the Emerald Isle may throw at you! </p>

            <h2 class="title">Essential Items</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Waterproof Backpack</h3>
                    <p>A must have for any hike, as you'll need it to carry any supplies with you and keep them dry.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Hiking Boots</h3>
                    <p>A decent pair of boots will keep your feet comfortable and provide a decent grip for any uphill climbs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Waterproof Clothing</h3>
                    <p>Ireland is known for spontaneous showers and damp conditions. Keep yourself warm with waterproof outer layers, like a raincoat and waterproof pants.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Food/Drink</h3>
                    <p>Always pack a meal and water for any hike. Chances are you won't run into a supermarket halfway up a mountain, so keep yourself fed and hydrated.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <!--optional items list-->
         <div id="optional-list" class="list">
            <h2 class="title">Optional Items</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Walking Pole/Stick</h3>
                    <p>A walking pole can help take unnecessary pressure from your body when hiking and provides extra stability on steep climbs. A decent stick can function just as well if there are some nearby.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Sunglasses + Sunscreen</h3>
                    <p>If the weather is particularly kind on your hike day, bring sunglasses and sunscreen with you. A gorgeous hike in the sun can be spoiled if you get sun burnt and peel like a potatoe when you return home.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>First Aid Kit</h3>
                    <p>When hiking particularly steep or dangerous areas, pack a first aid kit. If an accident occurs, you may need to apply medical attention to an injury.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Extra Phone Battery</h3>
                    <p>If you're going on any long hike, an extra phone battery never hurts. You may need to view maps of your area or call someone in a pinch, so keep your phone topped up on battery life.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Sleeping Bag/Tent</h3>
                    <p>If you're going on any long hike, an extra phone battery never hurts. You may need to view maps of your area or call someone in a pinch, so keep your phone topped up on battery life.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Multi-tool Knife</h3>
                    <p>Should you decide to make camp, a Multi-tool will prove invaluable to you. A multi-tool will have blades needed to collecting wood for a campfire, a decent multi-tool will also have a firestarting kit built in.</p>
